# Iris-Flower-Classification

This project is a classic machine learning task aimed at classifying iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on their sepal and petal measurements. It demonstrates fundamental ML concepts including supervised learning, data visualization, and model evaluation.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower using features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project is ideal for understanding the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

ðŸ§  Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree

Dataset: Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository or sklearn.datasets

ðŸ“Š Key Features
Data Exploration & Visualization: Visualized class distribution, feature relationships using pair plots and heatmaps.

Preprocessing: Checked for missing values, encoded target variables, and normalized the features.

Model Training: Built multiple classifiers to evaluate performance and accuracy.

Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.

âœ… Outcomes
Successfully classified iris species with high accuracy.

Gained hands-on experience with classification algorithms and model evaluation techniques.

Developed visual insights to better understand the structure and patterns in the data.
